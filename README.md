A long-established financial institution headquartered in Hyderabad, plans to launch a new line of credit cards to expand its product portfolio and strengthen its position in the financial market.
AtliQ Data Services learned about this initiative through an internal connection and proposed implementing the project. However, the bank’s strategy director, Mr. Bashnir Rover, expressed reservations and requested a pilot project to be conducted using a sample dataset before committing to the full project.
#Analyst Role
Mitron Bank provided a sample dataset comprising 4,000 customers from five cities, detailing their online spending and other relevant attributes.
The objective is to analyze the sample data and present key findings to Mitron Bank’s strategy team. This analysis will serve as a foundation for designing credit card offerings tailored to customer preferences and prevailing market trends.
